In order to obtain the arithmetic precision precision I added some extra words
in the stoplist.

These words are given below.
"document",
"discuss",
"report",
"include",
"describe",
"identify",
"predict",
"cite"

This was done in the code where I have created a list of stopwords in which
I added the above mentioned words in the list consisting of stopwords provided
for the assignment.

In code:

# Stop words manually added some more words
stopwords = open("./AP_DATA/stoplist.txt", "r").read().split("\n")
extra_words = ["document", "discuss", "report", "include", "describe",
              "identify", "predict", "cite"]
stopwords += extra_words
